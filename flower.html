            <p>hi! if you haven’t clicked on all the tools and set-up yet, it’d probably be best to look at those first! Go back home and click on the side objects :)</p>
            <p>OK, so I didn't know what to call this flower, so it's just a lily (which I know it's not LOL), but just bear with me. </p>
            <p>The tutorial below is how to embroider a sunflower, but you essentially use the same technique on all of the flowers that look like this :), so hope you enjoy the tutorial! (also it's very similar to leaves, so you can also check that out for more examples).</p>

            <p>WOO you've learned how to make this flower :) You can now either go back home or learn more designs in "other designs"!</p>
