        <a>embroidery floss is very similar to friendship bracelet string (remember summer camps haha), 
            but it’s a bit thicker and you don’t use the WHOLE string. lemme explain.</a>
        <a>when you begin pulling the floss, you’ll notice that there’s actually 6 individual strands within the larger strand! (pictured below). So, when you begin embroidering, 
            you actually can use anywhere from 1-6 strands depending on how detailed/thick you want your design to be. </a>
        <img class="thread" src="assets/img/6 strands.png" width=350px>
        <a>you can also choose from literally any color possible, like ANY. Each one also corresponds to it’s own 2-4 
            number code so if you need replacements, you can easily find one!</a>

            (the white holder of the floss pictured at the top), watch the video below! </a>
